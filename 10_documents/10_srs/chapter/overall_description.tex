\section{Overall description}
The purpose of this section is to provide a brief description of the project and to describe known actors and their interaction with the system. The section presents a high level view. For more detailed information, please refer to the developer team.

	\subsection{Stakeholders}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Rowing club administrators:} Must integrate the system into the rowing club's network infrastructure. Their concern is, that the system is usable for logging routes without any extended knowledge of computer systems.
		\item \textbf{Developers:} JEE course students, that are developing the system. Developers include architects, testers and quality engineers.
		\item \textbf{Rowing club members:} Use the system to log their rowed routes.
		\item \textbf{Lecturer:} Checks the state of development and marks the result of the developers for the JEE course.
		\item \textbf{Rowing club:} Organization that profits from the system, because it offers the possibility to create detailed statistics and provides a log.
		\item \textbf{Insurance company:} Interested in accident cases to view logged routes.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Actors}
	The following actors can be defined:\\
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Rowing club administrator:} The rowing club administrator uses the system to create and publish boats and routes. Rowing club administrators also use the system to generate analysis and view statistics. Another task of him is to observe the status of boats for retrieving information about damaged boats.
		\item \textbf{Rowing club member:} The rowing club member uses the system to log their rowed routes and publish these routes on their profile.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\subsection{Use case Model Survey}
	According to the four parts identified in section \ref{scope}, the use case model is broken into packages. The use cases presented in this survey are high level use cases and are presented in figure \ref{img:rowbuddyPackages}.

	\end{figure}
	
	
	
		\subsubsection{Package RowBuddy Online Storage}
		The use cases in the \textit{RowBuddy Online Storage package} deal with configuring, setting up and using the system as an administrator.\\
	
		\begin{figure}[H]

				\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/01_OnlineStorage.pdf}
				\caption{Use case diagram package Online Storage}
				\label{img:UConlineStorage}
			\end{center}
		\end{figure}

\hluc{HLUC-1}{Manage Boats}{Online Storage}{1}{wal}{}{%
		In this use case the admin configures boats. It includes adding, removing, browsing and locking a boat if it is damaged.
The user can select a free boat for the next tour.	
		}	

\hluc{HLUC-2}{Manage Users/Accounts}{Online Storage}{1}{wal}{}{%
		In this use case the admin configures users, user rights and accounts. Users
are members of the club. The user will automatically receive an account when they sign up in the club. This requires that an e-mail address is provided. The administrator also need additional functions within their user account.
This use case includes adding, browsing, changing, removing users and creating and removing accounts.	
		}

\hluc{HLUC-3}{Manage Routes}{Online Storage}{1}{wal}{}{%
		In this use case the Users configures routes. It includes adding, removing, browsing and changing routes. A route contains a name and description. A functionality will be provided that prevents duplicated Route entries.
		}
		
		
		\subsubsection{Package RowBuddy Route and Event Logger}
		The use cases in the \textit{RowBuddy Route and Event Logger package} deal with logging new routes and other things. Users may p.e. log a damaged boat.\\
	
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/02_RouteAndEventLogger.pdf}
				\caption{Use case diagram package Route and Event Logger}
				\label{img:UCrouteAndEventLogger}
			\end{center}
		\end{figure}
	
			\hluc{HLUC-4}{Start rowing a route}{Route and Event Logger}{1}{hei}{}{%
				In this use case a rowed route is recorded in the electronic logbook. The user that will start rowing a route selects a boat, the team mebers and a route.
			}
	
			\hluc{HLUC-5}{Stop rowing a route}{Route and Event Logger}{1}{hei}{}{%
				In this use case a startet routet created in HLUC-4 is stopped to provide the functionality to return from a trip. The route is then added in the users profile.
			}
	
			\hluc{HLUC-6}{Log rowed route}{Route and Event Logger}{1}{hei}{}{%
				In this use case a rowed route is recorded in the electronic logbook, if HLUC-4 was not executed. The user that rowed the route sets the date and time the route ended and started, the river the route was rowed on and either the GPS coordinates of ending- and starting-points or a short description of those. The route is then added in the users profile.
			}
			\hluc{HLUC-7}{Log damaged boat}{Route and Event Logger}{1}{hei}{}{%
				This use case deals with recording a damaged boat. The user inputs the type of boat, a description of what is damaged, when and where the defect occurred and optionally the incident that damaged the boat.
			}
		
		\subsubsection{Package RowBuddy Report Generator}
		The use cases in the \textit{RowBuddy Report Generator package} deal with generating all kinds of reports. The content of the reports are configurable to individualize the reports based on the logged routes.\\
